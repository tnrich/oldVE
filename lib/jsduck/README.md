JSDuck
======

API documentation generator for Sencha JavaScript frameworks.

JSDuck aims to be a better documentation generator for [Ext JS][] than
the old [ext-doc][] was. It is used by Sencha to document [Ext JS
4][ext4-docs], [Sencha Touch][touch2-docs] and [several other][other-docs]
products.

The highlights of JSDuck are [Markdown][] support and keeping you DRY
by inferring a lot of information from code.  Read the [Guide][] for
full overview.

Getting it
----------

Standard rubygems install should do:

    $ [sudo] gem install jsduck

If you encounter errors during gem installation, you may need to
install the header files for compiling extension modules for ruby 1.8.
For Debian systems you'll need the `ruby1.8-dev` package.  For Red Hat
/ CentOS / Fedora use the `ruby-devel` package.

For **Windows** users out there, you can download the binary version,
which includes Ruby interpreter and all dependencies bundled in a
single .exe file.  Grab it from the [download page][].

Usage
-----

For the simplest test-run just use the `--builtin-classes` option to
automatically produce documentation for JavaScript builtin classes
like Array, String and Object:

    $ jsduck --builtin-classes --output your/docs

You can also use `--verbose` option to see what's actually happening.

To generate docs for Ext JS 4 add path to the corresponding src/ dir:

    $ jsduck ext-4.0.7/src \
             --builtin-classes \
             --images ext-4.0.7/docs/images \
             --output your/docs

The `--images` option specifies a path for images included with
`{@img}` tags inside the source code.

To generate docs for your own project, simply name additional input
directories:

    $ jsduck ext-4.0.7/src project1/js project2/js ...

Note that the resulting documentation will only contain the API
documentation.  Guides, videos and examples will not be present.
These can be added using more command line options as explained in the
[Advanced Usage][adv] section of wiki.

Running latest JSDuck is expected to generate lots of warnings.
That's because some warning types were added after Ext JS 4.0.7
release.  Sorry for that, JSDuck just wants to be helpful.  If you are
overwhelmed by the warnings, you can disable them selectively using
something like `--warnings=-link_ambiguous,-no_doc` or you could
disable them all by `--warnings=-all`.

Another thing that often happens is that JSDuck is unable to determine
into which class a member belongs and will place all such items into a
global class - you can disable this using the `--ignore-global`
switch.  For full list of all command line options type
`jsduck --help=full`.
