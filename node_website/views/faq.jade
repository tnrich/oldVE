                h4 What are some applications of TeselaGen's technology?
                p DNA assembly allows scientists to engineer cells to more efficiently carry out desirable operations, such as producing medications and chemicals, converting plant material into biofuel, and breaking down toxic waste. Scientists pursuing these goals regularly seek to combine genes encoding a series of enzymes (biological catalysts) that perform the necessary reactions. This requires splicing together DNA parts - genes for multiple enzymes and shorter DNA sequences that regulate expression of those genes - to form recombinant DNA assemblies. The DNA assemblies are inserted into host cells, where they are expressed to produce the enzymes that carry out targeted reactions. While many of the steps involved in this type of genetic engineering have become easier with technological advances in the past several decades, design of complex DNA assemblies and efficient testing for function remains particularly challenging. Nevertheless, assemblies of increasing complexity and variability are needed for research in areas such as disease treatment, renewable energy, agriculture andeach vital to human health and the health of the planet. The commercial availability of our technology will provide a low cost, more effective and efficient alternative to current methods.<br><br>

                h4 Why are combinatorial DNA libraries so important?
                p It is common in the parlance of synthetic biology to speak in terms of forward engineering biological systems in much the same way that an electrical engineer might design and build an electronic circuit. However, biological systems are not as easily characterized or simulated as their electronic or mechanical counterparts, so real progress usually involves building and testing many variations of a genetic construct, and then performing functional tests in order to find the optimal DNA sequence that encodes the best performing biological system. While DNA synthesis costs are dropping rapidly, direct synthesis alone cannot address the combinatorial explosion that occurs when trying to optimize a DNA sequence that may contain even a small number of genetic elements. For example, a biologist trying to find better ways to convert biomass might wish to design a library with 10,000 constructs to screen for enzymatic activity. The cost of building and testing this library would be too expensive via direct synthesis. In contrast, using our patent-pending technology would cost at least an order of magnitude cheaper.
