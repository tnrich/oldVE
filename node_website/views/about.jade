  - team.push({ name: 'Mike Fero, Ph.D.', position: 'Founder and Chief Executive Officer', description:  'Prior to founding Teselagen, Dr. Fero was an NIH Quantitative Research Career Fellow and principal investigator at Stanford, studying the role of protein localization and the essential genomic elements needed for bacterial life. With Pat Brown and David Botstein Michael directed the development of the first full-genome human DNA microarrays. Before joining Stanford, he was VP of Software Engineering at Neomorphic, a computational genomics company acquired by Affymetrix, and a consulting scientist at Hyperparallel, a data mining company acquired by Yahoo!. Prior to his career in biotech, Michael was an Elementary Particle Physicist at MIT, CERN and SLAC where his work was vital to the measurement of the Left-Right Electroweak Asymmetry, which stands today as the worlds single best measurement of the Weinberg Angle. Michael has over 40 publications in peer-reviewed journals. Michael holds a Ph.D. in Elementary Particle Physics from the University of California at Irvine.',image : 'team/mfero_teselagen_pic2.jpg'})
