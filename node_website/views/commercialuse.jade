                h3 TeselaGen for Commercial User Agreement
                p This TeselaGen for Commercial Use Agreement (the "Agreement") is between TeselaGen, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("TeselaGen") and Customer or End User, as applicable. This Agreement governs access to and use of the TeselaGen for Commercial Use services and any client software (the "Services" or "TeselaGen for Commercial Use"). The Customer ordering the Services: If you are ordering the Services, then by clicking "I Agree," signing your contract for the Services or using TeselaGen for Commercial Use, you agree to this Agreement as a "Customer." If you are agreeing to this Agreement for use by an organization, you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of that organization. You must have the authority to bind that organization to this Agreement, otherwise you must not sign up for the Services. End Users: If you are using the Services as an "End User", then by clicking "I Agree" or using TeselaGen for Commercial Use you agree to this Agreement (especially note sections 1 and 13) and the TeselaGen Terms of Service at https://www.TeselaGen.com/terms. To the extent this Agreement conflicts with the TeselaGen Terms of Service, this Agreement controls. Please take note that in this Agreement, you are agreeing that your Administrator may be able to control account information and access to your TeselaGen for Commercial Use account. 
                h4 1. End Users
                p a. Accounts. When joining a TeselaGen for Commercial Use account, an End User may join with a new account or convert an existing personal account into a TeselaGen for Commercial Use account. It's important to note that once an End User's personal account becomes a TeselaGen for Commercial Use account, it will be subject to the Administrator's control. End Users must use the Services in compliance with any employment obligations and the Customer's terms and policies. b. Administrator Control. An End User's Administrator may have the ability to access, disclose, restrict, or remove information in or from an End User's TeselaGen for Commercial Use account. Administrators may also have the ability to monitor, restrict, or terminate access to an End User's TeselaGen for Commercial Use account. An End User may not be able to disassociate his or her TeselaGen for Commercial Use account from the organization. 
                h4 2. Customer Obligations
                p a. Compliance. Customer will use the Services in compliance with the TeselaGen Terms of Service including the Acceptable Use Policy. Customer will obtain and maintain any consents from End Users to allow Administrators to engage in the activities described in this Agreement and to allow TeselaGen to provide the Services. Customer represents, and must ensure, that its End Users are governed by this Agreement, the TeselaGen Terms of Service, and consent to the TeselaGen Privacy Policy. b. Customer Administration of the Services. Customer may specify End Users as "Administrators" through the administrative console. Customer is responsible for: (i) maintaining the confidentiality of passwords and Administrator accounts; (ii) managing access to Administrator accounts; and (iii) ensuring that Administrator use of the Services complies with this Agreement. TeselaGen's responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the Services for Customer. c. Unauthorized Use & Access. Customer will prevent unauthorized use of the Services by its End Users and terminate any unauthorized use of the Services. The Services are not intended for use by End Users under the age of 13. Customer will ensure that it does not allow any person under 13 to use the Services. Customer will promptly notify TeselaGen of any unauthorized use of, or access to, the Services. d. Restricted Uses. Customer will not (i) sell, resell, or lease the Services or (ii) use the Services for activities where use or failure of the Services could lead to physical damage, death, or personal injury. Customer, not TeselaGen, is responsible for any applicable vertical or industry-specific regulation compliance (e.g. HIPAA). e. Third Party Requests. i. "Third Party Request" means a request from a third party for records relating to an End User's use of the Services including information in or from an End User or Customer TeselaGen for Commercial Use account. Third Party Requests may include valid search warrants, court orders, or subpoenas, or any other request for which there is written consent from End Users permitting a disclosure. ii. Customer is responsible for responding to Third Party Requests via its own access to information. Customer will seek to obtain information required to respond to Third Party Requests and will contact TeselaGen only if it cannot obtain such information despite diligent efforts. iii. TeselaGen will make commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent allowed bylaw and by the terms of the Third Party Request, to: (A) promptly notify Customer of TeselaGen's receipt of a Third Party Request; (B) comply with Customer's commercially reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose a Third Party Request; and (C) provide Customer with information or tools required for Customer to respond to the Third Party Request (if Customer is otherwise unable to obtain the information). If Customer fails to promptly respond to any Third Party Request, then TeselaGen may, but will not be obligated to do so. f. Communication Setting Management. Customer is responsible for maintaining all "opt-in/out" settings for communications from or via TeselaGen for all of Customer's End Users. Customer will use reasonable efforts to answer any requests from End Users regarding such settings. 
                h4 3. Services
                p a. Provision of Services. Customer may access and use the Services made available by TeselaGen under this Agreement. b. Facilities and Data Transfer. TeselaGen will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all facilities used to store and process Customer Data meet commercially reasonable security standards. By using the Services, Customer consents to transfer, processing, and storage of Customer Data. "Customer Data" means any data and content stored or transmitted via the Services by Customer or End Users. c. Modifications to the Services. TeselaGen may update the Services from time to time. If TeselaGen changes the Services in a manner that materially reduces their functionality, TeselaGen will inform Customer, unless Customer has opted-out of communications of that type from TeselaGen. d. Limitations on Use of Services. TeselaGen may impose reasonable limitations on bandwidth usage for the Services. 
                h4 4. Support
                Customer will, at its own expense, respond to questions and complaints from End Users or third parties relating to use of the Services. Customer will use reasonable efforts to resolve support issues before escalating them to TeselaGen. 
                h4 5. Suspension
                p a. Of End User Accounts by TeselaGen. If an End User (i) violates this Agreement or the TeselaGen Terms of Service; (ii) uses the Services in a manner resulting in excessive support requests; or (iii) uses the Services in a manner that TeselaGen reasonably believes will cause it liability, then TeselaGen may request that Customer suspend or terminate the applicable End User account. If Customer fails to promptly suspend or terminate the End User account, then TeselaGen may do so. b. Security Emergencies. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, if there is a Security Emergency then TeselaGen may automatically suspend use of the Services. TeselaGen will make commercially reasonable efforts to narrowly tailor the suspension as needed to prevent or terminate the Security Emergency. "Security Emergency" means: (i) use of the Services that do or could disrupt the Services, other customers' use of the Services, or the infrastructure used to provide the Services and (ii) unauthorized third party access to the Services. 
                h4 6. Intellectual Property Rights
                p a. Reservation of Rights. THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT GRANT TESELAGEN ANY RIGHTS TO CUSTOMER'S OR END USERS' DATA OR THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS EMBODIED IN THOSE DATA EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED RIGHTS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT THAT ARE NEEDED TO RUN THE SERVICES. This Agreement does not grant Customer or End Users (i) any rights to the Intellectual Property Rights in the Services or (ii) any rights to use the TeselaGen trademarks, logos, domain names, or other brand features. "Intellectual Property Rights" means current and future worldwide rights under patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, moral rights, and other similar rights. b. Limited Permission. TeselaGen may need Customer permission to do things that Customer or End User ask TeselaGen to do with TeselaGen for Commercial Use accounts, for example, hosting files, or sharing them at Customer or End User's direction. This includes product features visible to Customer or End User, for example, image thumbnails or document previews. It also includes design choices made to technically administer the Services, for example, how the Service redundantly backs up data to keep it safe. Customer grants TeselaGen the permissions TeselaGen needs to do those things solely to provide the Services and for TeselaGen to meet its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. This permission also extends to third parties TeselaGen works with to provide the Services, for example Firehost, which provides TeselaGen's storage space (again, only to provide the Services). c. Suggestions. While we appreciate it when users send us feedback, we may, at our discretion and for any purpose, use, modify, and incorporate into our products and services, license and sublicense, any feedback, comments, or suggestions Customer or End Users send TeselaGen or post in TeselaGen's forums without any obligation to Customer or End Users. d. Customer List. TeselaGen may include Customer's name in a list of TeselaGen customers on the TeselaGen website. 
                h4 7. Third Party Services
                p If Customer uses any third-party service with the Services, (a) the service may access or use Customer's or End User's information; (b) TeselaGen will not be responsible for any act or omission of the third party, including the third party's use of Customer's or End User's information; and (c) TeselaGen does not warrant or support any service provided by the third party.

By TeselaGen. TeselaGen will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Customer from and against all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of a claim by a third party against Customer to the extent based on an allegation that TeselaGen's technology used to provide the Services to the Customer infringes or misappropriates any copyright, trade secret, U.S. patent, or trademark right of the third party. In no event will TeselaGen have any obligations or liability under this section arising from: (i) use of any Services in a modified form or in combination with materials not furnished by TeselaGen, and (ii) any content, information, or data provided by Customer, End Users or other third parties. c.

If TeselaGen does not believe the options described in this section are commercially reasonable then TeselaGen may suspend or terminate Customer's use of the impacted Services (with a pro- rata refund of pre-paid fees for the Services). d. General. The party seeking indemnification will promptly notify the other party of the claim and cooperate with the other party in defending the claim.

TeselaGen may not assign this Agreement without providing notice to Customer, except TeselaGen may assign this Agreement to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets without providing notice.
