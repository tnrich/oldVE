                    | Redbiotec will contribute its proprietary rePAX® technology for production of virus-like particles (VLPs) and multi- protein complexes and their expertise in the field of HCMV (human cytomegalovirus) to build a verified library of VLPs/multi-protein complexes for vaccine development and testing. By using TeselaGen’s technology, Redbiotec expects to accelerate the development of the new library. This library also will help reveal potential causes of virus latency and help elucidate virus-triggered cancer mechanisms.

                    | “TeselaGen’s experience and capabilities in automated DNA design are very important to Redbiotec”, said Christian Schaub, CEO, Redbiotec. “Our concept for novel Herpesvirus vaccines candidates requires the collection of a large amount of data on DNA as well as on manufacturing and analysis of the expressed viral constructs. In 2012 we surveyed the market for potential partners and discovered an ideal strategic partner in TeselaGen. TeselaGen is at the leading edge in terms of creating bio design technology that talks directly to high-throughput bio-production. After our achievements with HCMV vaccine development we are excited to apply both partners’ skills and technology to extend our pipeline further into Herpesviruses.”
